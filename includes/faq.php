      <button class="faq-question">Why should my company use Slack?</button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Excellent question. Slack is a way for your entire company to communicate. It replaces email with something faster, better organised and more secure. Instead of one-off email chains, all your communication is organised into channels that are easy to create, join and search. When there’s a channel for everything that’s happening at your company, everyone knows exactly where to go to get work done.</p>
